    "Based on the analysis, I recommend using the **combined model** for managing waste in both Region 1 and Region 2. The combined strategy results in a **lower total transportation cost** (\\$1,715,384) and **smaller total distance traveled** (2,008,649 miles-tons) compared to handling the regions separately, where the total transportation cost is \\$1,810,403 and the distance traveled is 2,123,134 miles-tons. Additionally, the **total daily cost** for the combined model is **\\$1,865,384**, which is lower than the total cost of managing the regions separately (\\$1,960,403). This ensures more efficient use of resources, reduced logistical complexity, and improved overall operational efficiency."
